### Analyst Notes

* Downloaded a sensitive object, indicating an entity's potential access to the bucket.  

---

### Recommended Actions

1. Confirm whether these IPs belong to approved personnel; if not, block them in the bucket policy and rotate any exposed credentials.  
2. Review the downloaded object for sensitive content and consider version rollback or server-side encryption with KMS.  
3. Enable GuardDuty S3 protection and object-level CloudTrail for real-time alerts on future suspicious access.  
4. Apply a restrictive bucket policy that denies `Get*` and `List*` calls from addresses outside corporate CIDRs.
