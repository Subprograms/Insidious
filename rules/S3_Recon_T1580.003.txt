### Analyst Notes

* HEAD requests can enumerate bucket existence without revealing contents.

---

### Recommended Actions

1. Restrict `s3:HeadBucket` to known IP ranges or IAM roles.  
2. Enable CloudTrail Data Events for bucket existence checks.  
3. Audit public buckets and validate need for external probing.
